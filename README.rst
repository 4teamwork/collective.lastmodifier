Introduction
============


SimpleLayout provides an intuitive way of adding and arranging the different
elements of a page such as paragraphs, images, files and links using
drag-and-drop functionality.
These elements are implemented as addable and easily arrangeable "blocks".
Because of the restricted dimensions of text, images and other content elements,
the general result is content with a uniform look and feel throughout the site.


Usage
=====

- Add the package to your buildout configuration:

::

    [instance]
    eggs +=
        ...
        ftw.simplelayout

- Install the generic setup profile.
